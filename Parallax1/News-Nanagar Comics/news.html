		<h3>
			29 July 2017 – On Global Tiger Day today, WWF is urging tiger-range governments to strengthen anti-poaching efforts and crack down on a severe wildlife snaring crisis that is threatening wildlife across Asia, especially the world’s remaining wild tigers, which number only around 3,900.
 
			Easy to make from widely available material such as bicycle cable wires and quick to set up, wire snares are deadly traps that are fast becoming the plague of Asia’s forests. Driven by the growing illegal wildlife trade, which is now reaching an estimated US$20 billion annually, poachers are increasingly using snares to trap wild tigers, elephants, leopards and other animals that are in high demand in the black market.  
			 
			“Snares are dangerous, insidious and quickly becoming a major contributor to the wave of extinction that is spreading throughout Southeast Asia – and tigers are being swept up in this crisis. All efforts to recover wild tigers are now imperiled by snaring on a massive scale. We cannot over emphasize the need for strong government commitment and investment in rangers who are on the frontline of conservation, clearing snares and apprehending those who set them,” said Mike Baltzer, Leader of WWF Tigers Alive.

			<h3> 
			Air pollution in our cities regularly contravenes EU limits. London breached its annual air pollution limit for 2017 in just five days. Decreasing vehicle emissions while maintaining or improving commuter journeys is a complex challenge and decisions made today about our transport systems will influence generations to come.
			The government set out its plans to tackle the problem last week. The main plank of its strategy is a commitment to ban the sale of new diesel and petrol cars and vans by 2040. The ambition to switch to electric vehicles is a signal for real change and is the direction we need to go, despite the associated upheaval and challenges in the form of extending battery range and life, ensuring adequate and conveniently positioned charging stations, generating enough clean electricity and overcoming the general lack of knowledge about the cost and convenience of owning an electric vehicle. The government’s plan, however, does not go nearly far enough. Our cities need fewer cars, not just cleaner cars. One issue is that electric vehicles will not sufficiently reduce particulate matter (PM), the other toxic pollutant emitted by road transport. This is because PM components include not only engine emissions, but also a contribution from brake and tyre wear and road surface abrasion. Governments don’t currently pay much attention to PM, but it is in fact highly polluting, with strong links to cardiopulmonary toxicity.

	<h2> Six clean tech innovations you need to know about </h2>
	<h3>
		Businesses wanting to improve their low carbon credentials rely on highly creative people to come up with new ideas. But for those innovators wanting to share their ideas, it can be hard to get projects off the ground. It takes time and money to refine products and business plans – things startups often don’t have. So what help is there for innovators wanting to give up their day jobs and focus on their inventions?
		One option is <a href="http://www.cleantechinnovate.com/">Cleantech Innovate</a>, a biannual event in London and Glasgow where low carbon innovators pitch for £20,000 and get to meet potential investors. Here are some of the exciting innovations that caught the eye at the most recent event this month.
	</h3>

	<h3>
		1. Steamed up
	</h3>
	<h3>
		Originally designed for boats, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzQDuT4DluQ">steam infusion</a> cooks huge quantities of food very quickly and evenly, keeping food nutritious and tasty. It works on liquid foods like sauces and soups by blasting them with steam travelling at three times the speed of sound, heating food from 20C to 80C in only a second, and can cook 1000kg of food in just 10 minutes.
		Designed by British engineering company <a href="http://www.oalgroup.com/">OAL Group</a> , steam infusion has been successfully making ready meals, ketchup, béchamel sauce and minestrone soup. It has been used to feed refugees in northern Iraq and to make a new maize-based nutritional drink in Zambia.
	</h3>

	<h3>
		2. Insulting robots
	</h3>
			
	<h3> 
		Also poised to improve our homes is q-bot, a London startup that has invented <a href="http://www.q-bot.co/">a robot</a>  that squeezes under floorboards and sprays insulation into areas that no human can reach.
		Putting in floor insulation can be very disruptive and takes at least a week. But with this remote-controlled gadget, a whole house can be done in a day.

		Inventor Mathew Holloway explains: “in many UK homes around one quarter of heat loss is through the floor. If there’s a draught coming up you can’t keep your home warm. q-bot makes it much easier to insulate under the floorboards, which means more people are more likely to have it done.”
		It’s great for draughty older buildings – like the 4.6m UK homes built before 1919. London’s Camden Council has used q-bot to insulate council housing without having to move tenants out.

	<h3>
		3. Harnessing the power of waves
	</h3>

	<h3>
		<a href="http://seawaveenergy.info/">Sea Wave Energy</a> turns the power of waves into electricity. The company’s latest innovation, designed by Adamos Zakheos, is the WaveLine Magnet – interconnected platforms that stick to the surface of the sea. As waves pass through the platforms, power converts to electricity.
		Spokesman Christopher Biggs explains: “Right now wave energy is in its infancy compared to other renewables, but the UK has one of the best wave resources in the world. There is enough wave energy out there to meet 22% of the UK’s electricity needs.”
		The next version, with 60 platforms, will be tested at FaBTest, a special wave-testing centre in Falmouth, Cornwall. “It is a low-tech way of producing energy without using fossil fuels ... One of our full-sized arrays will be capable of delivering 30,000 megawatt hours of electricity a year. It can also help prevent erosion by stopping waves lashing against the coast.”

		4. Compressed air meets salt caverns
	</h3>

	<h3>
		<a href="http://storelectric.com/index.html">Storelectric uses compressed air</a> to store energy from renewable sources in underground salt caverns. Founder Mark Howitt describes it as “the holy grail of energy supply. It’s the world’s biggest battery and it uses only air, water, salt and off-the-shelf equipment.”
		This design means renewable energy can be kept ready for when it’s needed. Salt caverns are already used to store natural gas, but Storelectric is the first company to successfully put air through a compressor and store it at a pressure about 30 times higher than tyre pressure.

	</h3>

	<h3>
		5. Breathing easy
	</h3>

	<h3>
		A new startup set to improve our homes is Adaptavate. Founders Thomas Robinson and Alberto Fernandez Minguela have developed a plasterboard replacement made from agricultural waste. Unlike plasterboard, which is classified as hazardous waste, Breathaboard is compostable, so any on-site waste will add nutrients, not pollution, to the soil.
		Robinson adds: “It’s breathable, preventing condensation and mould in the home, reducing diseases caused by damp housing like asthma. The breathability reduces the need for mechanical ventilation – cutting energy use.”
	</h3>

	<h3>
		6. A good egg
	</h3>

	
	<h3>
		People can only save energy if they know how much they are using, and several Cleantech finalists presented products to help with that. The GreenEgg Smart Home Hub displays energy consumption on a TV screen, making it easy for people to see.
