				A thick plume of smoke is rising from Italy's <a href="https://www.livescience.com/27871-mount-vesuvius-pompeii.html">Mount Vesuvius</a> but don't panic. Pompeii isn't about to happen all over again. The smoke, visible in a new set of satellite images released by the European Space Agency (ESA), is coming from a series of wildfires on the mountain. According to the ESA, much of the woodlands in Vesuvia National Park, which contains the volcano and its surroundings, have been destroyed. 
				The fires have forced evacuations near Naples, while tourists on Sicily had to flee separate fires by boat, according to <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/italy-wildfires-tourists-evacuate-sicily-vesuvius-calampiso-vito-lo-capo-puglia-beach-a7839846.html">The Indipendent</a> newspaper. Drought and high temperatures have driven the wildfires, but some officials suspect that some of the blazes on Mount Vesuvius were started by people, The Independent reported. Smoke obscures Vesuvius in new satellite images taken by the Copernicus Sentinel-2B satellite on July 12, and thermal images show a number of blazes dotting the active volcano.

		<h2>Planet Langard evolution</h2>
		<p>
			Long before Langard was known to have life, it was a giant water sphere with satellites of similar characteristics. The water was considered as the crust of the planet and underneath the crust is a mantle (about the size of planet earth) of various sands and soils.
			Various crops began to grow as it would happen in the sea and bubbling began to occur. As time went on air production and bubble sizes increased, bubbles began linking up creating bigger bubbles and this resulted in an air pocket between the water and the mantle.
			Planet Langard had a thin layer of H2o acting as the ozone layer. The air pocket gained more oxygen from the occurrence of Photosynthesis, as a result the water raised high above to a point where it linked with the ozone layer and what was left down beneath was the soil mantle and crops.
